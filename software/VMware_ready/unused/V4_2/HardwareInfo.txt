Equipment: 

Pololu jrk motor controller

2 dynamixel MX-28

3 dynamixel MX-64

Generic 12V linear actuator




Equipment setup and movement notes:

Linear actuator reversed in code. Dynamixel's rotate counterclockwise for positive incrementation

MX-28's control wrist movement

MX-64's control the elbow and the arm base. 2 on elbow, 1 on base.

the elbow dynamixels, ELBOW_DYNOA_ID, and ELBOW_DYNOB_ID, are situated as follows: standing behind the arm, A is the one on your left, B is the one on your right. The physical location
of the wrist dynamixel's unfortunately vary, so if someone changes their ID's out or loses their labels then you'll need to test in software to determine which is which. Or just 
look at it and see which one rotates in which direction to the arm -- to move the wrist up, wrist_dynoa moves in the CC direction, while wrist_dynob moves in the C direction

Wrist up motion: wrist_dynoa moves in CC motion, dynob in C motion. Reversed for wrist down.
Elbow up motion: Elbow_dynoa moves in C motion, dynob in CC motion. Reversed for elbow down.
Base follows direction of movement of base dynamixel (move it CC for CC arm motion).
